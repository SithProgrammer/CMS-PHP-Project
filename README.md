# CMS-PHP-Project

This is a CMS project I made to build my PHP and SQL skills. 

This project is using a database with 5 tables {categories, comments, posts, users, users_online}

It just contains random posts.

Posts have categories.

Search function to search by category.

BootStrap is used for styling.

New user registration page with encrypted password.

Admin access that is made by sessions.

Admin can add, edit, duplicate and delete posts, categories, and users.
